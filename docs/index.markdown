Alder is a multipurpose [Discord](https://discord.com) bot programmed in Python created by [narlock](https://github.com/narlock). It started out as a simple activity statistics tracking bot, but slowly evolved into a much larger project that offers a wide variety of features with the intention of keeping users motivated to become the best versions of themselves and also give them fun interactive features to enjoy.

If you find this project helpful or interesting, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê on [GitHub](https://github.com/narlock/AlderBot). Your support is greatly appreciated!
