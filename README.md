Alder is a multipurpose [Discord](https://discord.com) bot programmed in Python created by [narlock](https://github.com/narlock). It started out as a simple activity statistics tracking bot, but slowly evolved into a much larger project that offers a wide variety of features with the intention of keeping users motivated to become the best versions of themselves and also give them fun interactive features to enjoy.

If you find this project helpful or interesting, please consider giving it a ‚≠ê on GitHub. Your support is greatly appreciated!

For documentation, installation guide, and more about Alder, please visit our [web page](https://alder.narlock.dev)!

## Contributing to Alder
Alder is a tool that many people use on my Discord server. This is one of the driving factors for me opening the source code of the bot. There are many times where users have found bugs with Alder. Now that the code is open source, users can now create pull requests to fix bugs!

If you notice an issue with Alder, please create an issue on GitHub for it. If you have a solution to the issue, please create a pull request and mention the issue. Likewise, if you find someone else opening an issue and you would like to build a solution for it, please do so! Just remember to mention the issue.

### Guidelines
- Follow the [PEP 8 style](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for writing your Python code.
- Create comment documentation for each new function that you implement / fix you make (if necessary).
- Prioritize readability and maintainability rather than being performance efficient.

Don't worry about getting the guidelines perfect. This is what the pull requests are for. I've probably messed up plenty on this too! üòÉ
